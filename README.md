## About This Repository
This project is an [Userscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript) for [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) and began as a way to improve the readability of logs in populated games like Squad. Initially designed to highlight text, it has grown to include over a dozen features and quality-of-life improvements. The project has been rewritten to be easily forked and is now available for free. Primarily a passion project, it has been tested in Squad/Reforger communities but should theoretically work for all Battlemetrics-supported titles.

It's free and open source, please consider leaving a coffee https://ko-fi.com/synarion if you want to help :)

- This project's scope is limited to reading/modifying the **locally** delivered web content and locally injecting CSS and web improvements without touching the BM API (as such this code could run offline). Code suggestions that automates or performs interactive API requests like bans, kicks and queries using your Battlemetrics tokens will not be merged into this project as that approaches being a self bot which could result in your BM account being suspended. Add such code at your own risk.
